# Stock-Screening-Model-Based-On-Data-Envelopment-Analysis
A stock screening model based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The model intends to screen out the stocks whose financial statements appear to warrant a higher market cap, which makes the stock a potential value investing target.
In value investing, the first step is to look for potentially undervalued stocks. I borrowed an analytical algorithm from operational research, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), to help me find companies whose valuation comps are not warranted by their financial statements.
DEA is a method that enables us to compare and rank records based on their features without making any prior assumptions about the importance or weights of the features. Each record/stock has *M* inputs that measure the financial performances, and *N* outputs that measure the company’s valuation.

where, *E* is the efficiency of stock *i*, u and v are the weights of each output and input of the stock. Then the problem of finding the best weights for a particular stock i can be formulated as follows:

The above optimization problem can be solved with Linear Dynamic Programming. The h in the first equation is called efficiency. A low efficiency indicates that the company might be undervalued. To apply this algorithm to assist value investing, I used each company’s financial statistics as inputs and valuation comps as outputs:

**Inputs**: Beta, operating margin, profit margin, revenue per share, return on assets, return on equity, EPS, revenue growth, leverage ratio 

**Outputs**: Trailing P/E, forward P/E, EV/Sales, EV/EBIT, P/BV, PEG, P/sales

We can run this algorithm to all the stocks. The stocks with the lowest efficiency have the best chance of being undervalued, i.e., their financial statistics tell a different story from their valuation. What the algorithm gave me was a lead to a story that had to be developed. I would take a more in-depth look into the most undervalued stocks and analyse their fundamentals to decide if they are cheap for a valid reason.
